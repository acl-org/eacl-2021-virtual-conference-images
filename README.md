[![Deploy images to AWS S3](https://github.com/acl-org/eacl-2021-virtual-conference-images/actions/workflows/deploy_aws.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/acl-org/eacl-2021-virtual-conference-images/actions/workflows/deploy_aws.yml)

This repo contains images used for the EACL2021 virtual conference website https://virtual2021.eacl.org. These images are automatically published to a AWS S3 bucket.

If you want to change your image, please make a pull request just for your image against the master branch.

It would be cool only to change images of your own papers. 

If your paper does not have an image file and would like to add one, upload PNG files to `paper_images`folder and name it as `main.x.png`, and replace x with the softconf paper ID. Same for demo papers, format would be `demo.x.png`. 

It might take a while to be visible on the conference page.
